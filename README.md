# Merkle Trees
Merkle tree also known as hash tree is a data structure used for data verification and synchronization. 
It is a tree data structure where each non-leaf node is a hash of itâ€™s child nodes. All the leaf nodes are at the same depth. 
In this project,simple hash function is used for this purpose and to understand easily how data integrity is maintained.
